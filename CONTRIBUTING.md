## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue. To make things easier for contributors and maintainers, we use github issues option.

Please make sure to include a reproduction repository so that bugs can be reproduced without great efforts. The better a bug can be reproduced, the faster we can start fixing it!

## Pull Requests

However, any significant improvement should be associated to an existing feature request or bug report.
